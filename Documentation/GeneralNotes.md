## Preface
An assessment submit area will be set up for your Pair task. In this task, we will require you to upload your PPT and the runinng project example which demonstrate how you apply the choosen Style and Pattern in this particular practic project. on black 2 we will allocated the presentation time slot for each of the team. 

The presentation will be recorded as part of the evidence. Both team member need to be present. 

This presentation need demonstrate the understanding of the architectural design style and pattern. Based on your pratical practic project which style and pattern you apply? Why and how you apply the choose style and pattern in this project. Any difficult during you working on this task? How you resolve the issues?

## Decision
Sam and I have decided to pick the fourth project which is a file conversion application. We're gonna make the foundation of it and allow it to convert CSV to JSON, then hopefully can add a bit more functionality after that. This project relates to the Adapter pattern and we will need to stick to this, explain it in the presentation etc.

Our chosen style is Object oriented as it is what we are most familiar with and makes the most sense for our project.

### Design Reviews
Conduct design reviews at different stages of the process. Conceptual DesignReviews can occur after defining the architecture, Critical Design Reviewsafter specifying detailed designs, and Program (Static) Design Reviews toanalyze the static elements of the design.
### Architectural Design Pattern
- Define: 
    - Choose a specific architectural design pattern within the selected style (e.g., ifusing a microservices architecture, choose patterns such as API Gateway or EventSourcing). 
- Justify: 
    - Provide justification for selecting the specific design pattern. 
    - Consider how the chosen pattern addresses specific challenges or requirementswithin the system.
### Adapter Pattern
Implement a data conversion component that converts data from one formatto another. For example, the component could convert data from a comma-separated values (CSV) file to a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

## Plan
The plan is to reuse some of my code from the Software Development group project a while ago. We want to have 2 folders, an input and an output folder, and make the user type the file name in, check if it exists, then perform the conversion. 

We are going to make it simple and functional at first with just CSV to JSON then if we have time we will expand it and add more. We need to keep in mind that there is a lot of documentation to go along with this project and its due for next Tuesday.
